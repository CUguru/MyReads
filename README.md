## What is MyReads?

MyReads is a bookshelf project built with react. Books can be placed on three shelves, and react manages
the state of all the books on the shelves.

Users can also search for new books to add to a bookshelf on the search page. Books that are already on
a shelf will have their shelf state reflected on the search page.
